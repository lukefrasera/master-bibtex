abstract = {Service robots have the potential of improving the quality of life and assist with people’s daily activities. Such robots must be capable of operating over long periods of time, performingmultiple tasks, and scheduling them appro- priately for execution. In addition, service robots must be capable of dealing with tasks whose goals may be in conflict with each other and would need to determine, dynamically, which task to pursue in such a case. Adding to the complex- ity of the problem is the fact that some task requests may have time constraints—deadlines by which the task has to be completed. Given the dynamic nature of the environment, the robots must make decisions on what tasks to pursue in situ- ations where there could be incomplete or missing informa- tion. The robots should also be capable of accepting requests for new tasks or services at runtime, while possibly working on another task. In order to achieve these requirements, this paper presents the Auction Behavior-Based Robotic Archi- tecture that brings the following contributions: (1) it uses an auction mechanism to determine the relevance of a task to run at any given time, (2) it handles multiple user requests while dealing with potentially critical time constraints and incom- plete information, (3) it enables long-term robot operation and (4) it allows for dynamic assignment of new tasks. The proposed system is validated on a physical robotic platform, the Segway RMP? and in simulation.},

@article{Bicho2011,
abstract = {In this chapter we present results of our ongoing research on efficient and fluent human-robot collaboration that is heavily inspired by recent experimental findings about the neurocognitive mechanisms supporting joint action in humans. The robot control architecture implements the joint coordination of actions and goals as a dynamic process that integrates contextual cues, shared task knowledge and the predicted outcome of the user’s motor behavior. The architecture is formalized as a coupled system of dynamic neural fields representing a distributed network of local but connected neural populations with specific functionalities. We validate the approach in a task in which a robot and a human user jointly construct a toy ‘vehicle’. We show that the context-dependent mapping from action observation onto appropriate complementary actions allows the robot to cope with dynamically changing joint action situations. More specifically, the results illustrate crucial cognitive capacities for efficient and successful human-robot collaboration such as goal inference, error detection and anticipatory action selection.},

@article{Breazeal2004,
abstract = {This paper explores the topic of human-robot interaction (HRI) from the perspective of designing sociable autonomous robots-robots designed to interact with people in a human-like way. There are a growing number of applications for robots that people can engage as capable creatures or as partners rather than tools, yet little is understood about how to best design robots that interact with people in this way. The related field of human-computer interaction (HCI) offers important insights, however autonomous robots are a very different technology from desktop computers. In this paper, we look at the field of HRI from an HCI perspective, pointing out important similarities yet significant differences that may ultimately make HRI a distinct area of inquiry. One outcome of this discussion is that it is important to view the design and evaluation problem from the robot's perspective as well as that of the human. Taken as a whole, this paper provides a framework with which to design and evaluate sociable robots from a HRI perspective.},
